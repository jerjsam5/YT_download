wasn't working previously, yt.streams would show an empty list
had to run 'python -m pip install git+https://github.com/nficano/pytube' in the command line to get up to date pytube version

01/08/2021
now seeing the error "urllib.error.HTTPError: HTTP Error 410: Gone", thinking maybe pytube module has changed names or something like that. 
The example youtube url is still working so not an issue with that. 
looks like there's a bug in the pytube module that causes these errors (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68606981/how-do-i-download-youtube-videos-with-python)
