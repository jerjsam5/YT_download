wasn't working previously, yt.streams would show an empty list
had to run 'python -m pip install git+https://github.com/nficano/pytube' in the command line to get up to date pytube version

now seeing the error "urllib.error.HTTPError: HTTP Error 410: Gone", thinking maybe pytube module has changed names or something like that. 
The example youtube url is still working so not an issue with that. 
looks like there's a bug in the pytube module that causes these errors (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68606981/how-do-i-download-youtube-videos-with-python)

above issue has been resolved, just needed to upgrade pytube to version 11.0.1 (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68680322/pytube-urllib-error-httperror-http-error-410-gone)
